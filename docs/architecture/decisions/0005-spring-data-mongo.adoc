# 5. Persistence Layer Using Spring Data Mongo

Date: 2019-11-07

## Status

Deprecated

## Context

There are a collection of subprojects under the Spring Data umbrella. These projects provide a variety of persistent frameworks over relational database, NOSQL database, key/value stores, and graph databases. The document-based model used by spring-data-mongo is a natural fix between a java object model and the underlying NO SQL database.

## Decision

The programming model was very straightforward from a Java coding perspective. However, the use of Mongo ended up being problematic in that we did not have a good experience with ACID transactions and, while the spring data abstraction is really nice, we did not feel Mongo was the correct choice. We  may revisit this decision using a different NO SQL store like CosmoDB.

The following are useful links to help clarify the difference between Spring Data vs something like mybatis-spring. Many of the low-level data access concerns are abstracted away by Spring Data:

## Consequences

- There have been several base-level decisions that have been made to make it easier to leverage Spring Data MongoDB.
