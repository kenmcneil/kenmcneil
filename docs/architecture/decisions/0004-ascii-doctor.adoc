# 4. Ascii Doctor for repository documentation.

Date: 2019-11-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

ASCII Doctor is a text-based formatting langauage that is similar to Markdown. In my opinion, it has better formatting options compared with markdown and is rendered natively on GitHub. For more information:

- https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[Syntax Quick Reference]
- https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide[AsciiDoc Writer's Guide]
- https://gist.github.com/dcode/0cfbf2699a1fe9b46ff04c41721dda74[Hints for ASCII Doctor on GitHub]
- https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[Attributes can be used as directives to turn styling features on/off]

## Decision

This project has standardized it's in-repository documentation on ASCII doctor.

[TIP]
====
The rendering of icons across environments can be a bit tricky, the following works well assuming that the asciidocotor.css file is in the same directory as the .adoc file.

## Consequences

- We are not allowing in-repository documentation to use Markdown.
